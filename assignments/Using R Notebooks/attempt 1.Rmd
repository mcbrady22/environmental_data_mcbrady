My name is **Madison Brady** and I am in the *MS3 Program* at UMass.

I am excited to learn the following:

1. The actual syntax and "grammar" of programming languages
2. Some additional ways that computer data can be processed, interpreted,
and relayed to an audience, other than what I know from using excel and 
ArcMap

Some of my favorite courses at UMass include:

+ National Parks and Protected Areas

+ Fish Ecology

+ Alternative Dispute Resolution

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
