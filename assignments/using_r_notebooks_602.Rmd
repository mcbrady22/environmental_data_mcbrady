My name is **Madison Brady** and I am in the *MS3 Program* at UMass.

I am excited to learn the following:

1. The actual syntax and "grammar" of programming languages
2. Some additional ways that computer data can be processed, interpreted,
and relayed to an audience, other than what I know from using excel and 
ArcMap

Some of my favorite courses at UMass include:

+ National Parks and Protected Areas

+ Fish Ecology

+ Alternative Dispute Resolution

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
